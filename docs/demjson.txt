NAME
    demjson - A JSON data encoder and decoder.

FILE
    demjson.py

DESCRIPTION
    This Python module implements the JSON (http://json.org/) data
    encoding format; a subset of ECMAScript (aka JavaScript) for encoding
    primitive data types (numbers, strings, booleans, lists, and
    associative arrays) in a language-neutral simple text-based syntax.
    
    It can encode or decode between JSON formatted strings and native
    Python data types.  Normally you would use the encode() and decode()
    functions defined by this module, but if you want more control over
    the processing you can use the JSON class.
    
    This implementation tries to be as completely cormforming to all
    intricacies of the standards as possible.  It can operate in strict
    mode (which only allows JSON-compliant syntax) or a non-strict mode
    (which allows much more of the whole ECMAScript permitted syntax).
    This includes complete support for Unicode strings (including
    surrogate-pairs for non-BMP characters), and all number formats
    including negative zero and IEEE 754 non-numbers such a NaN or
    Infinity.
    
    The JSON/ECMAScript to Python type mappings are:
       ---JSON---             ---Python---
       null                   None
       undefined              undefined  (note 1)
       Boolean (true,false)   bool  (True or False)
       Integer                int or long  (note 2)
       Float                  float
       String                 str or unicode  ( "..." or u"..." )
       Array [a, ...]         list  ( [...] )
       Object {a:b, ...}      dict  ( {...} )
       
       -- Note 1. an 'undefined' object is declared in this module which
          represents the native Python value for this type when in
          non-strict mode.
    
       -- Note 2. some ECMAScript integers may be up-converted to Python
          floats, such as 1e+40.  Also integer -0 is converted to
          float -0, so as to preserve the sign (which ECMAScript requires).
    
       -- Note 3. numbers requiring more significant digits than can be
          represented by the Python float type will be converted into a
          Python Decimal type, from the standard 'decimal' module.
    
    In addition, when operating in non-strict mode, several IEEE 754
    non-numbers are also handled, and are mapped to specific Python
    objects declared in this module:
    
        NaN (not a number)     nan    (float('nan'))
        Infinity, +Infinity    inf    (float('inf'))
        -Infinity              neginf (float('-inf'))
    
    When encoding Python objects into JSON, you may use types other than
    native lists or dictionaries, as long as they support the minimal
    interfaces required of all sequences or mappings.  This means you can
    use generators and iterators, tuples, UserDict subclasses, etc.
    
    To make it easier to produce JSON encoded representations of user
    defined classes, if the object has a method named json_equivalent(),
    then it will call that method and attempt to encode the object
    returned from it instead.  It will do this recursively as needed and
    before any attempt to encode the object using it's default
    strategies.  Note that any json_equivalent() method should return
    "equivalent" Python objects to be encoded, not an already-encoded
    JSON-formatted string.  There is no such aid provided to decode
    JSON back into user-defined classes as that would dramatically
    complicate the interface.
    
    When decoding strings with this module it may operate in either
    strict or non-strict mode.  The strict mode only allows syntax which
    is conforming to RFC 7159 (JSON), while the non-strict allows much
    more of the permissible ECMAScript syntax.
    
    The following are permitted when processing in NON-STRICT mode:
    
       * Unicode format control characters are allowed anywhere in the input.
       * All Unicode line terminator characters are recognized.
       * All Unicode white space characters are recognized.
       * The 'undefined' keyword is recognized.
       * Hexadecimal number literals are recognized (e.g., 0xA6, 0177).
       * String literals may use either single or double quote marks.
       * Strings may contain \x (hexadecimal) escape sequences, as well as the
         \v and \0 escape sequences.
       * Lists may have omitted (elided) elements, e.g., [,,,,,], with
         missing elements interpreted as 'undefined' values.
       * Object properties (dictionary keys) can be of any of the
         types: string literals, numbers, or identifiers (the later of
         which are treated as if they are string literals)---as permitted
         by ECMAScript.  JSON only permits strings literals as keys.
    
    Concerning non-strict and non-ECMAScript allowances:
    
       * Octal numbers: If you allow the 'octal_numbers' behavior (which
         is never enabled by default), then you can use octal integers
         and octal character escape sequences (per the ECMAScript
         standard Annex B.1.2).  This behavior is allowed, if enabled,
         because it was valid JavaScript at one time.
    
       * Multi-line string literals:  Strings which are more than one
         line long (contain embedded raw newline characters) are never
         permitted. This is neither valid JSON nor ECMAScript.  Some other
         JSON implementations may allow this, but this module considers
         that behavior to be a mistake.

    class JSON(__builtin__.object)
     |  An encoder/decoder for JSON data streams.
     |  
     |  Usually you will call the encode() or decode() methods.  The other
     |  methods are for lower-level processing.
     |  
     |  Whether the JSON parser runs in strict mode (which enforces exact
     |  compliance with the JSON spec) or the more forgiving non-string mode
     |  can be affected by setting the 'strict' argument in the object's
     |  initialization; or by assigning True or False to the 'strict'
     |  property of the object.
     |  
     |  You can also adjust a finer-grained control over strictness by
     |  allowing or forbidding specific behaviors.  You can get a list of
     |  all the available behaviors by accessing the 'behaviors' property.
     |  Likewise the 'allowed_behaviors' and 'forbidden_behaviors' list which
     |  behaviors will be allowed and which will not.  Call the allow()
     |  or forbid() methods to adjust these.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, **kwargs)
     |      Creates a JSON encoder/decoder object.
     |      
     |      You may pass encoding and decoding options either by passing
     |      an argument named 'json_options' with an instance of a
     |      json_options class; or with individual keyword/values that will
     |      be used to initialize a new json_options object.
     |      
     |      You can also set hooks by using keyword arguments using the
     |      hook name; e.g., encode_dict=my_hook_func.
     |  
     |  call_hook(self, hook_name, input_object, position=None, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Wrapper function to invoke a user-supplied hook function.
     |      
     |      This will capture any exceptions raised by the hook and do something
     |      appropriate with it.
     |  
     |  clear_all_hooks(self)
     |      Unsets all hook callbacks, as previously set with set_hook().
     |  
     |  clear_hook(self, hookname)
     |      Unsets a hook callback, as previously set with set_hook().
     |  
     |  decode(self, txt, encoding=None, return_errors=False, return_stats=False)
     |      Decodes a JSON-encoded string into a Python object.
     |      
     |      The 'return_errors' parameter controls what happens if the
     |      input JSON has errors in it.
     |      
     |          * False: the first error will be raised as a Python
     |            exception. If there are no errors then the corresponding
     |            Python object will be returned.
     |      
     |          * True: the return value is always a 2-tuple: (object, error_list)
     |  
     |  decode_boolean(self, state)
     |      Intermediate-level decode for JSON boolean literals.
     |      
     |      Takes a string and a starting index, and returns a Python bool
     |      (True or False) and the index of the next unparsed character.
     |  
     |  decode_composite(self, state)
     |      Intermediate-level JSON decoder for composite literal types (array and object).
     |  
     |  decode_identifier(self, state, identifier_as_string=False)
     |      Decodes an identifier/keyword.
     |  
     |  decode_javascript_identifier(self, name)
     |      Convert a JavaScript identifier into a Python string object.
     |      
     |      This method can be overriden by a subclass to redefine how JavaScript
     |      identifiers are turned into Python objects.  By default this just
     |      converts them into strings.
     |  
     |  decode_null(self, state)
     |      Intermediate-level decoder for ECMAScript 'null' keyword.
     |      
     |      Takes a string and a starting index, and returns a Python
     |      None object and the index of the next unparsed character.
     |  
     |  decode_number(self, state)
     |      Intermediate-level decoder for JSON numeric literals.
     |      
     |      Takes a string and a starting index, and returns a Python
     |      suitable numeric type and the index of the next unparsed character.
     |      
     |      The returned numeric type can be either of a Python int,
     |      long, or float.  In addition some special non-numbers may
     |      also be returned such as nan, inf, and neginf (technically
     |      which are Python floats, but have no numeric value.)
     |      
     |      Ref. ECMAScript section 8.5.
     |  
     |  decode_string(self, state)
     |      Intermediate-level decoder for JSON string literals.
     |      
     |      Takes a string and a starting index, and returns a Python
     |      string (or unicode string) and the index of the next unparsed
     |      character.
     |  
     |  decodeobj(self, state, identifier_as_string=False, at_document_start=False)
     |      Intermediate-level JSON decoder.
     |      
     |      Takes a string and a starting index, and returns a two-tuple consting
     |      of a Python object and the index of the next unparsed character.
     |      
     |      If there is no value at all (empty string, etc), then None is
     |      returned instead of a tuple.
     |  
     |  encode(self, obj, encoding=None)
     |      Encodes the Python object into a JSON string representation.
     |      
     |      This method will first attempt to encode an object by seeing
     |      if it has a json_equivalent() method.  If so than it will
     |      call that method and then recursively attempt to encode
     |      the object resulting from that call.
     |      
     |      Next it will attempt to determine if the object is a native
     |      type or acts like a squence or dictionary.  If so it will
     |      encode that object directly.
     |      
     |      Finally, if no other strategy for encoding the object of that
     |      type exists, it will call the encode_default() method.  That
     |      method currently raises an error, but it could be overridden
     |      by subclasses to provide a hook for extending the types which
     |      can be encoded.
     |  
     |  encode_boolean(self, bval, state)
     |      Encodes the Python boolean into a JSON Boolean literal.
     |  
     |  encode_composite(self, obj, state, obj_classification=None)
     |      Encodes just composite objects: dictionaries, lists, or sequences.
     |      
     |      Basically handles any python type for which iter() can create
     |      an iterator object.
     |      
     |      This method is not intended to be called directly.  Use the
     |      encode() method instead.
     |  
     |  encode_date(self, dt, state)
     |  
     |  encode_datetime(self, dt, state)
     |  
     |  encode_enum(self, val, state)
     |      Encode a Python Enum value into JSON.
     |  
     |  encode_equivalent(self, obj, state)
     |      This method is used to encode user-defined class objects.
     |      
     |      The object being encoded should have a json_equivalent()
     |      method defined which returns another equivalent object which
     |      is easily JSON-encoded.  If the object in question has no
     |      json_equivalent() method available then None is returned
     |      instead of a string so that the encoding will attempt the next
     |      strategy.
     |      
     |      If a caller wishes to disable the calling of json_equivalent()
     |      methods, then subclass this class and override this method
     |      to just return None.
     |  
     |  encode_null(self, state)
     |      Produces the JSON 'null' keyword.
     |  
     |  encode_number(self, n, state)
     |      Encodes a Python numeric type into a JSON numeric literal.
     |      
     |      The special non-numeric values of float('nan'), float('inf')
     |      and float('-inf') are translated into appropriate JSON
     |      literals.
     |      
     |      Note that Python complex types are not handled, as there is no
     |      ECMAScript equivalent type.
     |  
     |  encode_string(self, s, state)
     |      Encodes a Python string into a JSON string literal.
     |  
     |  encode_time(self, t, state)
     |  
     |  encode_timedelta(self, td, state)
     |  
     |  encode_undefined(self, state)
     |      Produces the ECMAScript 'undefined' keyword.
     |  
     |  has_hook(self, hook_name)
     |  
     |  islineterm(self, c)
     |      Determines if the given character is considered a line terminator.
     |      
     |      Ref. ECMAScript section 7.3
     |  
     |  isws(self, c)
     |      Determines if the given character is considered as white space.
     |      
     |      Note that Javscript is much more permissive on what it considers
     |      to be whitespace than does JSON.
     |      
     |      Ref. ECMAScript section 7.2
     |  
     |  recover_parser(self, state)
     |      Try to recover after a syntax error by locating the next "known" position.
     |  
     |  set_hook(self, hookname, function)
     |      Sets a user-defined callback function used during encoding or decoding.
     |      
     |      The 'hookname' argument must be a string containing the name of
     |      one of the available hooks, listed below.
     |      
     |      The 'function' argument must either be None, which disables the hook,
     |      or a callable function.  Hooks do not stack, if you set a hook it will
     |      undo any previously set hook.
     |      
     |      Netsted values.  When decoding JSON that has nested objects or
     |      arrays, the decoding hooks will be called once for every
     |      corresponding value, even if nested.  Generally the decoding
     |      hooks will be called from the inner-most value outward, and
     |      then left to right.
     |      
     |      Skipping. Any hook function may raise a JSONSkipHook exception
     |      if it does not wish to handle the particular invocation.  This
     |      will have the effect of skipping the hook for that particular
     |      value, as if the hook was net set.
     |      
     |      AVAILABLE HOOKS:
     |      
     |      * decode_string
     |          Called for every JSON string literal with the
     |          Python-equivalent string value as an argument. Expects to
     |          get a Python object in return.
     |      
     |      * decode_float:
     |          Called for every JSON number that looks like a float (has
     |          a ".").  The string representation of the number is passed
     |          as an argument.  Expects to get a Python object in return.
     |      
     |      * decode_number:
     |          Called for every JSON number. The string representation of
     |          the number is passed as an argument.  Expects to get a
     |          Python object in return.  NOTE: If the number looks like a
     |          float and the 'decode_float' hook is set, then this hook
     |          will not be called.
     |      
     |      * decode_array:
     |          Called for every JSON array. A Python list is passed as
     |          the argument, and expects to get a Python object back.
     |          NOTE: this hook will get called for every array, even
     |          for nested arrays.
     |      
     |      * decode_object:
     |          Called for every JSON object.  A Python dictionary is passed
     |          as the argument, and expects to get a Python object back.
     |          NOTE: this hook will get called for every object, even
     |          for nested objects.
     |      
     |      * encode_value:
     |          Called for every Python object which is to be encoded into JSON.
     |      
     |      * encode_dict:
     |          Called for every Python dictionary or anything that looks
     |          like a dictionary.
     |      
     |      * encode_dict_key:
     |          Called for every dictionary key.
     |      
     |      * encode_sequence:
     |          Called for every Python sequence-like object that is not a
     |          dictionary or string. This includes lists and tuples.
     |      
     |      * encode_bytes:
     |          Called for every Python bytes or bytearray type; or for
     |          any memoryview with a byte ('B') item type.  (Python 3 only)
     |      
     |      * encode_default:
     |          Called for any Python type which can not otherwise be converted
     |          into JSON, even after applying any other encoding hooks.
     |  
     |  skip_comment(self, state)
     |      Skips an ECMAScript comment, either // or /* style.
     |      
     |      The contents of the comment are returned as a string, as well
     |      as the index of the character immediately after the comment.
     |  
     |  skipws(self, state)
     |      Skips all whitespace, including comments and unicode whitespace
     |      
     |      Takes a string and a starting index, and returns the index of the
     |      next non-whitespace character.
     |      
     |      If the 'skip_comments' behavior is True and not running in
     |      strict JSON mode, then comments will be skipped over just like
     |      whitespace.
     |  
     |  skipws_nocomments(self, state)
     |      Skips whitespace (will not allow comments).

    class buffered_stream(__builtin__.object)
     |  A helper class for the JSON parser.
     |  
     |  It allows for reading an input document, while handling some
     |  low-level Unicode issues as well as tracking the current position
     |  in terms of line and column position.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __getitem__(self, index)
     |      Returns the character at the given index relative to the current position.
     |      
     |      If the index goes beyond the end of the input, or prior to the
     |      start when negative, then '' is returned.
     |      
     |      If the index provided is a slice object, then that range of
     |      characters is returned as a string. Note that a stride value other
     |      than 1 is not supported in the slice.  To use a slice, do:
     |      
     |          s = my_stream[ 1:4 ]
     |  
     |  __init__(self, txt='', encoding=None)
     |  
     |  __repr__(self)
     |  
     |  at_eol(self, allow_unicode_eol=True)
     |      Returns True if the current position contains an
     |      end-of-line control character.
     |  
     |  at_ws(self, allow_unicode_whitespace=True)
     |      Returns True if the current position contains a white-space
     |      character.
     |  
     |  clear_saved_position(self)
     |  
     |  peek(self, offset=0)
     |      Returns the character at the current position, or at a
     |      given offset away from the current position.  If the position
     |      is beyond the limits of the document size, then an empty
     |      string '' is returned.
     |  
     |  peekstr(self, span=1, offset=0)
     |      Returns one or more characters starting at the current
     |      position, or at a given offset away from the current position,
     |      and continuing for the given span length.  If the offset and
     |      span go outside the limit of the current document size, then
     |      the returned string may be shorter than the requested span
     |      length.
     |  
     |  pop(self)
     |      Returns the character at the current position and advances
     |      the position to the next character.  At the end of the
     |      document this function returns an empty string.
     |  
     |  pop_identifier(self, match=None)
     |      Pops the sequence of characters at the current position
     |      that match the syntax for a JavaScript identifier.
     |  
     |  pop_if_startswith(self, s)
     |      Pops the sequence of characters if they match the given string.
     |      
     |      See also method: startswith()
     |  
     |  pop_while_in(self, chars)
     |      Pops a sequence of characters at the current position
     |      as long as each of them is in the given set of characters.
     |  
     |  popif(self, testfn)
     |      Just like the pop() function, but only returns the
     |      character if the given predicate test function succeeds.
     |  
     |  popstr(self, span=1, offset=0)
     |      Returns a string of one or more characters starting at the
     |      current position, and advances the position to the following
     |      character after the span.  Will not go beyond the end of the
     |      document, so the returned string may be shorter than the
     |      requested span.
     |  
     |  popuntil(self, testfn, maxchars=None)
     |      Just like popwhile() method except the predicate function
     |      should return True to stop the sequence rather than False.
     |      
     |      See also methods: skipuntil() and popwhile()
     |  
     |  popwhile(self, testfn, maxchars=None)
     |      Pops all the characters starting at the current position as
     |      long as each character passes the given predicate function
     |      test.  If maxchars a numeric value instead of None then then
     |      no more than that number of characters will be popped
     |      regardless of the predicate test.
     |      
     |      See also methods: skipwhile() and popuntil()
     |  
     |  reset(self)
     |      Clears the state to nothing.
     |  
     |  restore_position(self)
     |  
     |  rewind(self)
     |      Resets the position back to the start of the input text.
     |  
     |  save_position(self)
     |  
     |  set_text(self, txt, encoding=None)
     |      Changes the input text document and rewinds the position to
     |      the start of the new document.
     |  
     |  skip(self, span=1)
     |      Advances the current position by one (or the given number)
     |      of characters.  Will not advance beyond the end of the
     |      document.  Returns the number of characters skipped.
     |  
     |  skip_to_next_line(self, allow_unicode_eol=True)
     |      Advances the current position to the start of the next
     |      line.  Will not advance beyond the end of the file.  Note that
     |      the two-character sequence CR+LF is recognized as being just a
     |      single end-of-line marker.
     |  
     |  skipuntil(self, testfn)
     |      Advances the current position until a given predicate test
     |      function succeeds, or the end of the document is reached.
     |      
     |      Returns the actual number of characters skipped.
     |      
     |      The provided test function should take a single unicode
     |      character and return a boolean value, such as:
     |      
     |          lambda c : c == '.'   # Skip to next period
     |      
     |      See also methods: skipwhile() and popuntil()
     |  
     |  skipwhile(self, testfn)
     |      Advances the current position until a given predicate test
     |      function fails, or the end of the document is reached.
     |      
     |      Returns the actual number of characters skipped.
     |      
     |      The provided test function should take a single unicode
     |      character and return a boolean value, such as:
     |      
     |          lambda c : c.isdigit()   # Skip all digits
     |      
     |      See also methods: skipuntil() and popwhile()
     |  
     |  skipws(self, allow_unicode_whitespace=True)
     |      Advances the current position past all whitespace, or until
     |      the end of the document is reached.
     |  
     |  startswith(self, s)
     |      Determines if the text at the current position starts with
     |      the given string.
     |      
     |      See also method: pop_if_startswith()

     |  lookup_codec(encoding)
     |      Wrapper around codecs.lookup().
     |      
     |      Returns None if codec not found, rather than raising a LookupError.
     |  
     |  make_raw_bytes(byte_list)
     |      Constructs a byte array (bytes in Python 3, str in Python 2) from a list of byte values (0-255).
     |  
     |  make_surrogate_pair(codepoint)
     |      Given a Unicode codepoint (int) returns a 2-tuple of surrogate codepoints.
     |  
     |  safe_unichr(codepoint)
     |      Just like Python's unichr() but works in narrow-Unicode Pythons.
     |  
     |  strip_format_control_chars(txt)
     |      Filters out all Unicode format control characters from the string.
     |      
     |      ECMAScript permits any Unicode "format control characters" to
     |      appear at any place in the source code.  They are to be
     |      ignored as if they are not there before any other lexical
     |      tokenization occurs.  Note that JSON does not allow them,
     |      except within string literals.
     |      
     |      * Ref. ECMAScript section 7.1.
     |      * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_control_characters
     |      
     |      There are dozens of Format Control Characters, for example:
     |          U+00AD   SOFT HYPHEN
     |          U+200B   ZERO WIDTH SPACE
     |          U+2060   WORD JOINER
     |  
     |  surrogate_pair_as_unicode(c1, c2)
     |      Takes a pair of unicode surrogates and returns the equivalent unicode character.
     |      
     |      The input pair must be a surrogate pair, with c1 in the range
     |      U+D800 to U+DBFF and c2 in the range U+DC00 to U+DFFF.
     |  
     |  unicode_as_surrogate_pair(c)
     |      Takes a single unicode character and returns a sequence of surrogate pairs.
     |      
     |      The output of this function is a tuple consisting of one or two unicode
     |      characters, such that if the input character is outside the BMP range
     |      then the output is a two-character surrogate pair representing that character.
     |      
     |      If the input character is inside the BMP then the output tuple will have
     |      just a single character...the same one.
     |  
     |  unicode_decode(txt, encoding=None)
     |      Takes a string (or byte array) and tries to convert it to a Unicode string.
     |      
     |      Returns a named tuple:  (string, codec, bom)
     |      
     |      The 'encoding' argument, if supplied, should either the name of
     |      a character encoding, or an instance of codecs.CodecInfo.  If
     |      the encoding argument is None or "auto" then the encoding is
     |      automatically determined, if possible.
     |      
     |      Any BOM (Byte Order Mark) that is found at the beginning of the
     |      input will be stripped off and placed in the 'bom' portion of
     |      the returned value.

    class jsonlint(__builtin__.object)
     |  This class contains most of the logic for the "jsonlint" command.
     |  
     |  You generally create an instance of this class, to defined the
     |  program's environment, and then call the main() method.  A simple
     |  wrapper to turn this into a script might be:
     |  
     |      import sys, demjson
     |      if __name__ == '__main__':
     |          lint = demjson.jsonlint( sys.argv[0] )
     |          return lint.main( sys.argv[1:] )
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, program_name='jsonlint', stdin=None, stdout=None, stderr=None)
     |      Create an instance of a "jsonlint" program.
     |      
     |      You can optionally pass options to define the program's environment:
     |      
     |        * program_name  - the name of the program, usually sys.argv[0]
     |        * stdin   - the file object to use for input, default sys.stdin
     |        * stdout  - the file object to use for outut, default sys.stdout
     |        * stderr  - the file object to use for error output, default sys.stderr
     |      
     |      After creating an instance, you typically call the main() method.
     |  
     |  main(self, argv)
     |      The main routine for program "jsonlint".
     |      
     |      Should be called with sys.argv[1:] as its sole argument.
     |      
     |      Note sys.argv[0] which normally contains the program name
     |      should not be passed to main(); instead this class itself
     |      is initialized with sys.argv[0].
     |

    class position_marker(__builtin__.object)
     |  A position marks a specific place in a text document.
     |  It consists of the following attributes:
     |  
     |      * line - The line number, starting at 1
     |      * column - The column on the line, starting at 0
     |      * char_position - The number of characters from the start of
     |                        the document, starting at 0
     |      * text_after - (optional) a short excerpt of the text of
     |                     document starting at the current position
     |  
     |  Lines are separated by any Unicode line separator character. As an
     |  exception a CR+LF character pair is treated as being a single line
     |  separator demarcation.
     |  
     |  Columns are simply a measure of the number of characters after the
     |  start of a new line, starting at 0.  Visual effects caused by
     |  Unicode characters such as combining characters, bidirectional
     |  text, zero-width characters and so on do not affect the
     |  computation of the column regardless of visual appearance.
     |  
     |  The char_position is a count of the number of characters since the
     |  beginning of the document, starting at 0. As used within the
     |  buffered_stream class, if the document starts with a Unicode Byte
     |  Order Mark (BOM), the BOM prefix is NOT INCLUDED in the count.

    class utf32(codecs.CodecInfo)
     |  Unicode UTF-32 and UCS4 encoding/decoding support.
     |  
     |  This is for older Pythons whch did not have UTF-32 codecs.
     |  
     |  JSON requires that all JSON implementations must support the
     |  UTF-32 encoding (as well as UTF-8 and UTF-16).  But earlier
     |  versions of Python did not provide a UTF-32 codec, so we must
     |  implement UTF-32 ourselves in case we need it.
     |

     |  Static methods defined here:
     |  
     |  decode(obj, errors='strict', endianness=None)
     |      Decodes a UTF-32 byte string into a Unicode string.
     |      
     |      Returns tuple (bytearray, num_bytes)
     |      
     |      The errors argument shold be one of 'strict', 'ignore',
     |      'replace', 'backslashreplace', or 'xmlcharrefreplace'.
     |      
     |      The endianness should either be None (for auto-guessing), or a
     |      word that starts with 'B' (big) or 'L' (little).
     |      
     |      Will detect a Byte-Order Mark. If a BOM is found and endianness
     |      is also set, then the two must match.
     |      
     |      If neither a BOM is found nor endianness is set, then big
     |      endian order is assumed.
     |  
     |  encode(obj, errors='strict', endianness=None, include_bom=True)
     |      Encodes a Unicode string into a UTF-32 encoded byte string.
     |      
     |      Returns a tuple: (bytearray, num_chars)
     |      
     |      The errors argument should be one of 'strict', 'ignore', or 'replace'.
     |      
     |      The endianness should be one of:
     |          * 'B', '>', or 'big'     -- Big endian

     |      
     |      If include_bom is true a Byte-Order Mark will be written to
     |      the beginning of the string, otherwise it will be omitted.
     |  
     |  lookup(name)
     |      A standard Python codec lookup function for UCS4/UTF32.
     |      
     |      If if recognizes an encoding name it returns a CodecInfo
     |      structure which contains the various encode and decoder
     |      functions to use.

FUNCTIONS
    decode(txt, encoding=None, **kwargs)
        Decodes a JSON-encoded string into a Python object.
        
        == Optional arguments ==
        
        * 'encoding'  (string, default None)
        
           This argument provides a hint regarding the character encoding
           that the input text is assumed to be in (if it is not already a
           unicode string type).
        
           If set to None then autodetection of the encoding is attempted
           (see discussion above). Otherwise this argument should be the
           name of a registered codec (see the standard 'codecs' module).
        
        * 'strict'    (Boolean, default False)
        
            If 'strict' is set to True, then those strings that are not
            entirely strictly conforming to JSON will result in a
            JSONDecodeError exception.
        
        * 'return_errors'    (Boolean, default False)
        
            Controls the return value from this function. If False, then
            only the Python equivalent object is returned on success, or
            an error will be raised as an exception.
        
            If True then a 2-tuple is returned: (object, error_list). The
            error_list will be an empty list [] if the decoding was
            successful, otherwise it will be a list of all the errors
            encountered.  Note that it is possible for an object to be
            returned even if errors were encountered.
        
        * 'return_stats'    (Boolean, default False)
        
            Controls whether statistics about the decoded JSON document
            are returns (and instance of decode_statistics).
        
            If True, then the stats object will be added to the end of the
            tuple returned.  If return_errors is also set then a 3-tuple
            is returned, otherwise a 2-tuple is returned.
        
        * 'write_errors'    (Boolean OR File-like object, default False)
        
            Controls what to do with errors.
        
            - If False, then the first decoding error is raised as an exception.
            - If True, then errors will be printed out to sys.stderr.
            - If a File-like object, then errors will be printed to that file.
        
            The write_errors and return_errors arguments can be set
            independently.
        
        * 'filename_for_errors'   (string or None)
        
            Provides a filename to be used when writting error messages.
        
        * 'allow_xxx', 'warn_xxx', and 'forbid_xxx'    (Booleans)
        
            These arguments allow for fine-adjustments to be made to the
            'strict' argument, by allowing or forbidding specific
            syntaxes.
        
            There are many of these arguments, named by replacing the
            "xxx" with any number of possible behavior names (See the JSON
            class for more details).
        
            Each of these will allow (or forbid) the specific behavior,
            after the evaluation of the 'strict' argument.  For example,
            if strict=True then by also passing 'allow_comments=True' then
            comments will be allowed.  If strict=False then
            forbid_comments=True will allow everything except comments.
        
        Unicode decoding:
        -----------------
        The input string can be either a python string or a python unicode
        string (or a byte array in Python 3).  If it is already a unicode
        string, then it is assumed that no character set decoding is
        required.
        
        However, if you pass in a non-Unicode text string (a Python 2
        'str' type or a Python 3 'bytes' or 'bytearray') then an attempt
        will be made to auto-detect and decode the character encoding.
        This will be successful if the input was encoded in any of UTF-8,
        UTF-16 (BE or LE), or UTF-32 (BE or LE), and of course plain ASCII
        works too.
        
        Note though that if you know the character encoding, then you
        should convert to a unicode string yourself, or pass it the name
        of the 'encoding' to avoid the guessing made by the auto
        detection, as with
        
            python_object = demjson.decode( input_bytes, encoding='utf8' )
        
        Callback hooks:
        ---------------
        You may supply callback hooks by using the hook name as the
        named argument, such as:
            decode_float=decimal.Decimal
        
        See the hooks documentation on the JSON.set_hook() method.
    
    decode_file(filename, encoding=None, **kwargs)
        Decodes JSON found in the given file.
        
        See the decode() function for a description of other possible options.
    
    determine_float_limits(number_type=<type 'float'>)
        Determines the precision and range of the given float type.
        
        The passed in 'number_type' argument should refer to the type of
        floating-point number.  It should either be the built-in 'float',
        or decimal context or constructor; i.e., one of:
        
            # 1. FLOAT TYPE
            determine_float_limits( float )
        
            # 2. DEFAULT DECIMAL CONTEXT
            determine_float_limits( decimal.Decimal )
        
            # 3. CUSTOM DECIMAL CONTEXT
            ctx = decimal.Context( prec=75 )
            determine_float_limits( ctx )
        
        Returns a named tuple with components:
        
             ( significant_digits,
               max_exponent,
               min_exponent )
        
        Where:
            * significant_digits -- maximum number of *decimal* digits
                 that can be represented without any loss of precision.
                 This is conservative, so if there are 16 1/2 digits, it
                 will return 16, not 17.
        
            * max_exponent -- The maximum exponent (power of 10) that can
                 be represented before an overflow (or rounding to
                 infinity) occurs.
        
            * min_exponent -- The minimum exponent (negative power of 10)
                 that can be represented before either an underflow
                 (rounding to zero) or a subnormal result (loss of
                 precision) occurs.  Note this is conservative, as
                 subnormal numbers are excluded.
    
    determine_float_precision()
        # For backwards compatibility with older demjson versions:
    
    encode(obj, encoding=None, **kwargs)
        Encodes a Python object into a JSON-encoded string.
        
        * 'strict'    (Boolean, default False)
        
            If 'strict' is set to True, then only strictly-conforming JSON
            output will be produced.  Note that this means that some types
            of values may not be convertable and will result in a
            JSONEncodeError exception.
        
        * 'compactly'    (Boolean, default True)
        
            If 'compactly' is set to True, then the resulting string will
            have all extraneous white space removed; if False then the
            string will be "pretty printed" with whitespace and
            indentation added to make it more readable.
        
        * 'encode_namedtuple_as_object'  (Boolean or callable, default True)
        
            If True, then objects of type namedtuple, or subclasses of
            'tuple' that have an _asdict() method, will be encoded as an
            object rather than an array.
            If can also be a predicate function that takes a namedtuple
            object as an argument and returns True or False.
        
        * 'indent_amount'   (Integer, default 2)
        
            The number of spaces to output for each indentation level.
            If 'compactly' is True then indentation is ignored.
        
        * 'indent_limit'    (Integer or None, default None)
        
            If not None, then this is the maximum limit of indentation
            levels, after which further indentation spaces are not
            inserted.  If None, then there is no limit.
        
        CONCERNING CHARACTER ENCODING:
        
        The 'encoding' argument should be one of:
        
            * None - The return will be a Unicode string.
            * encoding_name - A string which is the name of a known
                  encoding, such as 'UTF-8' or 'ascii'.
            * codec - A CodecInfo object, such as as found by codecs.lookup().
                  This allows you to use a custom codec as well as those
                  built into Python.
        
        If an encoding is given (either by name or by codec), then the
        returned value will be a byte array (Python 3), or a 'str' string
        (Python 2); which represents the raw set of bytes.  Otherwise,
        if encoding is None, then the returned value will be a Unicode
        string.
        
        The 'escape_unicode' argument is used to determine which characters
        in string literals must be \u escaped.  Should be one of:
        
            * True  -- All non-ASCII characters are always \u escaped.
            * False -- Try to insert actual Unicode characters if possible.
            * function -- A user-supplied function that accepts a single
                 unicode character and returns True or False; where True
                 means to \u escape that character.
        
        Regardless of escape_unicode, certain characters will always be
        \u escaped. Additionaly any characters not in the output encoding
        repertoire for the encoding codec will be \u escaped as well.
    
    encode_to_file(filename, obj, encoding='utf-8', overwrite=False, **kwargs)
        Encodes a Python object into JSON and writes into the given file.
        
        If no encoding is given, then UTF-8 will be used.
        
        See the encode() function for a description of other possible options.
        
        If the file already exists and the 'overwrite' option is not set
        to True, then the existing file will not be overwritten.  (Note,
        there is a subtle race condition in the check so there are
        possible conditions in which a file may be overwritten)
