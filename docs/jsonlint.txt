Usage: jsonlint [-v] [-s|-S] [-f|-F] [-e codec] inputfile.json ...

The return status will be 0 if the file is legal JSON, or
non-zero otherwise.  Use -v to see the warning details.

Options are:
 -v | --verbose    Show details of lint checking
 -s | --strict     Be strict in what is considered legal JSON
 -S | --nonstrict  Be loose in what is considered legal JSON
 -f | --format     Reformat the JSON (if legal) to stdout
 -F | --format-compactly
        Reformat the JSON simlar to -f, but do so compactly by
        removing all unnecessary whitespace

 -e codec | --encoding=codec
 --input-encoding=codec
 --output-encoding=codec
         Set the input and output character encoding codec (e.g.,
         ascii, utf8, utf-16).  The -e will set both the input and
         output encodings to the same thing.  If not supplied, the
         input encoding is guessed according to the JSON
         specification.  The output encoding defaults to UTF-8, and is
         used when reformatting (via the -f or -F options).

When reformatting, all members of objects (associative arrays) are
always output in lexigraphical sort order.  The default output codec
is UTF-8, unless the -e option is provided.  Any Unicode characters
will be output as literal characters if the encoding permits,
otherwise they will be \u-escaped.  You can use "-e ascii" to force
all Unicode characters to be escaped.
