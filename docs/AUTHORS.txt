===================
In general, thanks to the entire Python community for providing such
a wonderful language.  Thanks also to the folks at json.org for
developing the JSON data format and pursuing an RFC standard for it.

Reported bugs:

  * Adam Braun -- reported bug in 1.0 release regarding newlines being
        rejected during decoding if at the beginning of the input.

  * Nicolas Bonardelle -- reported bug in 1.1 release where the wrong
        kind of exception could be raised by encode_default().

  * Tom Kho and Yanxin Shi -- independently reported bug in the 1.4
        release, that when encoding Python strings to JSON, occurances
        of character U+00FF (ASCII 255 or 0xFF) may result in an
        error.

  * Brian Bloniarz -- reported a bug in 1.5 for the jsonlint
        command where it could not properly accept and parse from
        standard input (stdin).
